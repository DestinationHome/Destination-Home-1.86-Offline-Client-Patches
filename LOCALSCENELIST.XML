==================

🐞 Known Issue's/Bugs:

• Since the overall client is almost at 20GB "18.0GB's" the startup/boot time when launching Home will take a little longer then normal. The reason to this is because the client has to verify/mount over 1,000+ Items & preload scene data at boot (there is over 200+ spaces that Home has to scan.) As far as I know, there is no way to minimize the loading time for the offline client. I would recomend when booting Home just wait for 1-2 minutes before launching any scene/space so you can avoid any errors.

======================================

📄 Scripts/Commands:

Credit: Nagato

• Added the ability to enable Development Release Mode on PlayStation Home. By "emulating" dip switch commands that are only found on actual DECR unit's "DECR-1000A/J models we can enable some more debug features. 

• Debug units "DECHA00A" or DEX PS3's can now utilze DECR functions without the use of having "dipswitches".

This includes the following features: 

➤ Switches to development mode.
➤P ress the right analogue stick to enter a free flight mode. When in flight mode, press R1 to raise the camera vertically and R2 to lower it. The left analogue stick strafes the camera in the XZ plane. The right analogue stick controls the orientation of the camera. *This means you can enable debugcam by just hitting R3, like back on 89/97 builds.*

⚠️ NOTE: by turning (off) the dip switch commands will put you back into release mode. *Retail* As well if you happen to own a DECR you don't need to utilize any of these functions since it's already built in via hardware. As well if you want to revert back to "release mode" please use the hubstartup script that is found in a folder called "Original HubStartup"

➤ Switches to release mode.
➤ Press the right analogue stick to enter an `over-the-shoulder' third person camera mode.
➤ Press SELECT to access the Debug Console

🐞 Known Issue's/Bugs:

• Note when loading into the Audi Vertical Run space there might be a 30 second delay when trying to load up to the actual game. Don't worry it will take some time to launch however, the game does work. As well there might be some freezing while launching into the scene itself, I usually just wait it out until I become unfrozen.

Credit goes to Calibre for rebuilding LMO's/Icons.

======================================

🐞 Known Issue's/Bugs:

照英王国 Shoei Kingdom (JP): Note this space has a collision bug.

For this simple fix you'll need a keyboard.

To walk through the rest of the scene hit "SELECT" and you want to enable "***DEV DEBUG*** 

Once you enabled, DEV Debug you want to select the *Open Console* Option, and you should the command prompt tab.

In the CMD prompt you want to first type this command *disableCharacterCollision 1* this will allow you to walk in the space and then you want to re-enable by utilzing this command *disableCharacterCollision 0* once you get past the door. For more information on how to do this please refer to the video that is in the root folder of this patch.

----------------------------------

Palace Of The Seven Winds: Note this space has a collision bug.

For this space becareful while walking around, since this scene used a special object to enable *flight mode* originally the bottom of the map has an invisible floor. If you happen to fall off you can either reload the scene from the navigator. Or just use the command `teleport 1 1 1` 

For more information about this bug and it's fix check out the video in the root of this patch.

----------------------------------

For the "Drop Science Gilet - Werk It Female Jacket" to utilize this item you can copy/paste this command "Person.Local.SetClothingComponent 07029742-01454F61-B2F2E605-52D46746"

- For some reason this object isn't showing in the female's invetory however, utilizing this command works.
