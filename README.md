# Destination-Home-1.86-Offline-Client-Patches:

The purpose of this repository is provide a source of the latest patches/updates for PlayStation Home's 1.86 offline client. These patches may include new clothing, LMO's, scripts, screenlink, .SDC's/Metadata fixes & more for the end user. 

I recommend for users who want to install patches, to make sure to installing each patch in **chronological order**, so you won't accidently overwrite any file's or changes in later patches. Skipping patches can lead into **items/spaces not showing up correctly on your navigator**, thus it's best for the end user to start with patch **v1.00** and just go > up to whatever is the latest version.
